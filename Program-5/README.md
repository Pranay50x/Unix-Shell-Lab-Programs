# Note there are two versions of the scripts
## Regular version namely 5b.sh and 5a.sh run completely fine on Ubuntu and other Linux distributions
## The versions with 5a-mac.awk and 5b-mac.awk are for Mac OS users as the stat command is different on Mac OS and also highly recommmended to do install gawk to run your awk scripts in the bash terminal in Mac OS
```bash
brew install gawk
```
### Make sure to install Homebrew before installing gawk.
